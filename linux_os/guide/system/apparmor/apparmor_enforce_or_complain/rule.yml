title: 'Ensure AppArmor Profiles are in enforce or complain'

description: |-
    AppArmor profiles define what resources applications are able to access.
    <br /><br />
    Run the following command and verify that profiles are loaded, profiles are in enforce or 
    complain mode:
    <pre>apparmor_status | grep profiles</pre>

    Output will be similar to:
    <pre>37 profiles are loaded.
    35 profiles are in enforce mode.
    2 profiles are in complain mode.
    4 processes have profiles defined.</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Review the output to ensure no processes are unconfined:
    <pre>apparmor_status | grep processes</pre>

    Output will be similar to:
    <pre>4 processes have profiles defined.
    4 processes are in enforce mode.
    0 processes are in complain mode.
    0 processes are unconfined but have a profile defined.</pre>
    <br /><br />

rationale: |-
    Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may mandate a policy 
    that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly acceptable. This item is intended 
    to ensure that any policies that exist on the system are activated.

ocil_clause: 'Profiles are in enforce or complain and there are no unconfined processes'

ocil: |-
    To verify that Apparmor Profiles are in enforce or complain mode,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo apparmor_status | grep profiles</pre>
    The output lines should resemble the following:
    <pre>37 profiles are loaded.
    35 profiles are in enforce mode.
    2 profiles are in complain mode.
    4 processes have profiles defined.</pre>>
