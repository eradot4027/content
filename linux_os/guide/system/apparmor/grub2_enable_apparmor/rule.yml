title: 'Ensure AppArmor is Not Disabled in /etc/default/grub'

description: |-
    AppArmor can be disabled at boot time by an argument in
    <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>.
    Remove any instances of <tt>apparmor=0</tt> from the kernel arguments in that
    file to prevent AppArmor from being disabled at boot.

rationale: |-
    Disabling a major host protection feature, such as AppArmor, at boot time prevents
    it from confining system services at boot time.  Further, it increases
    the chances that it will remain off during system operation.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'AppArmor is disabled at boot time'

ocil: |-
    Inspect <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> for any instances of <tt>apparmor=0</tt>
    in the kernel boot arguments.  Presence of <tt>apparmor=0</tt> indicates
    that AppArmor is disabled at boot time.
