title: AppArmor

description: |-
    AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system which is a kernel 
    (LSM) enhancement to confine programs to a limited set of resources. 
    AppArmor's security model is to bind access control attributes to programs
    rather than to users. AppArmor confinement is provided via profiles loaded
    into the kernel, typically on boot. AppArmor profiles can be in one of two modes: 
    enforcement and complain. Profiles loaded in enforcement mode will result in
    enforcement of the policy defined in the profile as well as reporting policy 
    violation attempts (either via syslog or auditd). Profiles in complain mode will 
    not enforce policy but instead report policy violation attempts.
    <br /><br />
    AppArmor differs from some other MAC systems on Linux: it is path-based, it
    allows mixing of enforcement and complain mode profiles, it uses include files to
    ease development, and it has a far lower barrier to entry than other popular MAC systems.
    <br /><br />
    AppArmor is an established technology first seen in Immunix and later integrated into Ubuntu,
    Novell/SUSE, and Mandriva. Core AppArmor functionality is in the mainline Linux kernel from 2.6.36 onwards;
    work is ongoing by AppArmor, Ubuntu and other developers to merge additional AppArmor functionality into the
    mainline kernel.

    This guide recommends that SELinux be enabled using the
    default (targeted) policy on every {{{ full_name }}} system, unless that
    system has unusual requirements which make a stronger policy
    appropriate.
